And why is it important to avoid overfitting?\n\nOverfitting is when a machine learning model learns the noise in the data. When a model is overfitted, it is highly accurate when tested on the training set, but when tested on a new data set, the accuracy of the model decreases drastically. Overfitting is one of the most common problems in machine learning.\n\nOverfitting is the process of training a model on the training set using all the available features. This results in a model that has high accuracy on the training set but performs poorly on the test set. The main reason why overfitting is a big problem is that the training set is typically different from the test set.\n\nThis is because the training set is chosen to be representative of the population of interest, while the test set is chosen to be representative of the future population.

Start with reading and writing\n2. Understand the math behind NLP\n3. Get your hands dirty with NLP\n4. Know the tools for NLP\n5. Practice, practice and more practice.\nTo get more in-depth information, refer to this article.\n\n## Recommended online resources to learn NLP\n\nThere are many learning resources available online, which you can check out to learn natural language processing. Some of them are listed below.\n\n## 10 Real-World Natural Language Processing Applications\n\nNatural language processing (NLP) is a branch of computer science that enables computers to understand, interpret and manipulate human language. In this post, we'll take a look at some of the most popular applications of NLP and explore the real-world applications of NLP in different fields.\n\n### 1. Speech Recognition\n\nSpeech recognition, also known as speech to text, is an NLP technique that allows a computer to recognize and transcribe human speech. This technology is used in many different applications, such as voice assistants, like Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant, and Cortana, dictation software, and speech-based interfaces for smart devices. Speech recognition uses machine learning to identify patterns in human speech and convert it into a written format.\n\n### 2. Machine Translation\n\nMachine translation is an NLP technique that allows a computer to translate text from one language to another. This technology is used in many different applications, such as translation software, web browsers, and email services. Machine translation uses statistical models and machine learning algorithms to analyze the source text and generate an equivalent translation in the target language.\n\n### 3. Sentiment Analysis\n\nSentiment analysis is an NLP technique that enables a computer to analyze and interpret the emotional content of human language. This technology is used in many different applications, such as social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and market research. Sentiment analysis uses natural language processing techniques, such as machine learning and text analysis, to analyze and categorize language into positive, negative, and neutral sentiment categories.\n\n### 4. Question Answering\n\nQuestion answering is an NLP technique that enables a computer to answer questions based on human language. This technology is used in many different applications, such as search engines, chatbots, and virtual assistants. Question answering uses natural language processing techniques to identify and extract information from text-based sources, such as websites and documents, and provide an answer to a specific question.\n\n### 5. Text summarization\n\nText summarization is an NLP technique that enables a computer to generate a summary of human language text. This technology is used in many different applications, such as news aggregators, search engines, and email services. Text summarization uses natural language processing techniques to identify important information in a text-based source, such as a document or website, and provide a concise summary of the information.\n\n### 6. Part-of-Speech Tagging\n\nPart-of-speech tagging is an NLP technique that enables a computer to identify the grammatical function of words in human language. This technology is used in many different applications, such as text analysis, natural language generation, and machine translation. Part-of-speech tagging uses natural language processing techniques, such as machine learning and rule-based approaches, to assign each word in a text-based source a grammatical tag, such as noun, verb, or adjective.\n\n### 7. Information Extraction\n\nInformation extraction is an NLP technique that enables a computer to extract relevant information from human language text. This technology is used in many different applications, such as web scraping, data mining, and search engines. Information extraction uses natural language processing techniques, such as text analysis and machine learning, to identify and extract information from text-based sources, such as documents, websites, and social media.\n\n### 8. Text Classification\n\nText classification is an NLP technique that enables a computer to categorize text-based sources into predefined categories. This technology is used in many different applications, such as spam filtering, document categorization, and sentiment analysis. Text classification uses natural language processing techniques, such as machine learning and rule-based approaches, to assign a text-based source to a predefined category, such as news, opinion, or advertising.\n\n### 9. Named Entity Recognition\n\nNamed entity recognition (NER) is an NLP technique that enables a computer to identify and classify entities mentioned in human language. This technology is used in many different applications, such as speech recognition, machine translation, and search engines. Named entity recognition uses natural language processing techniques, such as text analysis and machine learning, to identify and categorize entities, such as people, places, organizations, and products, mentioned in text-based sources.\n\n### 10. Text Generation\n\nText generation is an NLP technique that enables a computer to generate human language text. This technology is used in many different applications, such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and email generation. Text generation uses natural language processing techniques, such as machine learning and rule-based approaches, to generate text-based responses to input prompts, such as questions, commands, or requests.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nNatural language processing is a field that has undergone tremendous growth and advancement in recent years, and the applications of NLP are continuing to expand.
